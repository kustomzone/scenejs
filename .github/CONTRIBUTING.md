Development Workflow for the SceneJS Repo
=========================================

**To contribute code to the SceneJS repo:**

1. Create a feature branch off of **master** with an informative name.
2. Make your modifications to the codebase and commit them to your feature branch.
3. When you feel your modifications are ready to be reviewed, open a pull request to the **dev** branch.
4. @xeolabs or @tsherif will be responsible for reviewing code changes and will comment on any concerns in the pull request (other developers are also welcome to comment).
6. When concerns have been resolved, @xeolabs or @tsherif will merge the feature branch into **dev**.
